This fork contains added programs weather-app.py and camera-viewer.py.
Some additional packages that may be required should be installed using pip:

pip install requests json geocoder

weather-app.py gives the date, time, and weather in your current location with real time updates.
Note: You need to register for a free OpenWeatherMap API key and set the variable "api_key" with your key in weather-app.py.
https://openweathermap.org/appid

camera-viewer.py was a test to see if the screen can display video.  It works, but at a very low FPS.
