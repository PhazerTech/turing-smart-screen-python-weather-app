This is a fork from turing-smart-screen-python created by mathoudebine.
https://github.com/mathoudebine/turing-smart-screen-python

This fork contains added programs weather-app.py and camera-viewer.py.

weather-app gives the date, time, and weather in your current location and gives real time updates.
Note: You need to register for a free OpenWeatherMap API key and replace the corresponding variable in weather-app.py with your API key.

camera-viewer was a test to see if the screen can display video.  It works, but at a very low FPS.
